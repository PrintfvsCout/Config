# Specialization
My main focus and 4 years of startup experience is in web-based applications with **Next.js** and React **JS/TS**. I have 1 year of experience working with **Flutter** on mobile applications, so my approach for web applications is always mobile-first. My primary focus is the fintech industry as well as AI and Web3 projects or any web project using React. I do not have any experience working with AI projects or Web3, but I am a fast learner and can easily catch on. 

I enjoy architecting React projects and simplifying any codebase. My experience also consists of **system design** as well. When I write code, I heavily borrow elements from functional programming, especially writing pure functions that are easy to test and maintain.

## Experience with architecting React projects using:
- Module-based architecture
- Atomic Design
- Custom architectures tailored for your business! <a href="mailto:sp-milo&#64;proton.me">sp-milo@proton.me</a>
- Feature-based Architecture

## Strictly following engineering :
- React S.O.L.I.D. and OOP S.O.L.I.D.
- MVC 
- DRY, KISS, YAGNI and SOC
